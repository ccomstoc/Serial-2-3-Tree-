# Serial-2-3-Tree-

This project involves the serial implementation of a 2-3 tree, undertaken during my senior year in a parallel programming class. Despite learning about the parallel functionality of a 2-3 tree, our implementation focused on the serial aspect. The detailed project description is available in [projectDesc.pdf](projectDesc.pdf), and the output is documented in [output.txt](output.txt).

In the initial section of [driver.cpp](driver.cpp), my partner and I manually constructed a 2-3 tree for testing purposes. This approach aided in refining the program's functionality, although the manual construction could be optimized due to its current bulkiness.

To aid in the process, I worked on extending the tree class with [printFancy](printFancy.h). While this extension remains unfinished, it served as a valuable tool for visualizing the tree structure during the program's development.
