# Serial-2-3-Tree-
This serial implementation of a 2-3 tree was completed for my parallel programming class senior year.
While we learned the way a parallel 2-3 tree functions, we only implemented it serially. 
The project description can be found at [projectDesc.pdf](projectDesc.pdf).
Output can be found in [output.txt](output.txt).

In the beginning of [driver.cpp](driver.cpp) you can see that me and my partner decided to build a 2-3 tree manually for testing
purposes. This was to help in developing the functionality of the program. It is a bit bulky and could be redone. 

As a side project, I worked on an extension of the tree class called [printFancy](printFancy.h). While it is unfinished,
it helped to visualize the tree while we developed the program.
