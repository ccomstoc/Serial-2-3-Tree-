# Serial-2-3-Tree-
A serial implementation of a 2-3 tree completed for my parallel programming class senior year.
While we leaned the way a parallel 2-3 tree fucntions, we only implemented it serialy. 
Project description can be found at [projectDesc.pdf](projectDesc.pdf)
Output can be found in [output.txt](output.txt)

In the begining of [driver.cpp](driver.cpp) you can see that me and my partner decided in build a 2-3 tree manaully for testing
purposes. This was to help in developing the functionality of the program. It is a bit bulky and could be redone. 

As I side project I worked on an extention of the tree class called [printFancy](printFancy.h). While it is unfinished,
it helped to visualize the tree while we developed the program.
